<p>1. Encourage Transparency and Patient Focused System:&nbsp;<br></p><p>Higher rated hospitals scoring AVG rating of 93.4% are Non-profit hospitals while For-Profit hospitals are scoring AVG of 64.6%, this shows how significantly Non-Profit hospitals are emphasizing on patient-focused approach and  transparency. The worry of making share holders happy being taken out of this equation and more of sharing success stories, patient testimonials, and quality metrics can enhance trust and credibility. As such I recommend more of the other ownership types should follow the standards of this Non-Profit hospitals.</p><p>2. Optimize Staffing:</p><p>AVG Hospital beds in the US increased from 6013 available beds in 2020 to 65466 available beds in 2021 which is a 988.74% increase. The same year we saw most hospitals rating score improved significantly. By looking at this we can clearly see the hospitals that had the highest available beds and adequately staffed employees to handle those beds have scored consistently high in the health quality score of patients. Hence hospitals should assess their staffing levels regularly. If staff cuts are affecting patient care, reevaluating these decisions and ensuring appropriate staff-to-patient ratios can enhance the quality of care provided.</p><p>3. Strategic Planning:</p><p>States like AZ that had a 72.19% decrease in available hospital bed in 2020 had a 16.29% decrease in rating and this hospitals experiencing decreased bed counts YOY should conduct a thorough analysis as to why they are reducing their available beds. If the decrease is due to changing demographics, consider reallocating resources to areas with higher demand. I also recommend collaborating with local health authorities to aid in understanding long-term regional healthcare needs.</p><p>4. Invest in Training:<br></p><p>States like CA who had an AVG rating of 71.4% in 2019 which changed to 63.3% in 2020 which is a 11.3% decrease shows that even though CA is one of the few states with the highest budgets for healthcare, even though hospitals in the state have adequate resources a decrease in AVG rating might indicate the problem might lay on employee training. I recommend these hospitals should provide additional training and resources to healthcare professionals in regions with lower quality scores. Addressing knowledge gaps and ensuring standardized practices can improve overall quality.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1422/7/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
