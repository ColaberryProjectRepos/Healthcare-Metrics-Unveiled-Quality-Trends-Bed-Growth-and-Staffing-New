On top of that I had multiple ranged for one record which made it even more complicated so I had to first load them as is to the staging area under the StartDate column but right after they are loaded I set up a stored procedure that will be executed by an execute sql task to clean this records and split the date ranges to the appropriate StartDate and EndDate Column.</span><br style="color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">2: The other major problem I have faced was that my Score column had mix of null, string and numeric data types so I had to fix this issue before loading&nbsp; my main staging database since I needed it to be numeric. I also needed to do a lookup on the second data set that I had that had the information about the hospitals employee and available bed count. In doing this I was able to separate the hospitals that reported their employee and bed counts to the ones that didn't and gave the one that didn't 'N/A' value for that columns</span><br style="color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">3: Since I did not want to load Null values for my score to my ODS as it is my source of my dim tables which then feed my fact tables I had to use and Update Statement to change the Null values to '-1' after being loaded.</span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1422/14/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><br></span></p>
